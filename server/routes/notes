This folder will be used to define my routes. This includes
login
logout
products (name and category)
register
category
users history

We will need to get the controllers for these for isntance

const loginRouter = express.Router();
loginRouter.post('/', authenticateUser);

authenticareUser will need to be imported from the controllers

We will then export the all and make available to the server.js file.
