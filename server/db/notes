This will be used for the databse. It will have a break down of 
how the tables are structured might contain SQL code - I need to check this.

This will have the logic for quering the database. Queries against the schema

It may also have a pool that we will use for the different processes. 

const pool = new Pool({
    user: process.env.DB_USERNAME,
    host: process.env.DB_HOST,
    database: process.env.DATABASE,
    password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
    port: process.env.DB_PORT,
});

module.exports = pool;
